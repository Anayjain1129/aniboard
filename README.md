## Info

I made this keyboard since I wanted a keyboard with the Function keys and I use use two displays so it is not actually possible to use my laptop's keyboard all the time, I made this keyboard.

I think this i s perfect keyboard for me as it has a RE and a OLED display, which can help for like increasing hte volume or decreasing, and the display can help me with the things like the spotify stuff.

Oh and it also looks very nice in my eyes. Took me more than **40 hours** making the PCB, Case and researching for the BOM. I was really so much fun to make it.

## PCB

The PCB's size is 360.4mm x 130.4mm

## Total Pricing

The keyboard comes out to be 11217.83 INR ($129.23) When ordering all the parts I'm not including  the 3D parts because I will be getting them from Print Legion.

## Notes :-

I want all the two 3D-printed parts to be printed in black color. that includes: top.step, bottom.step .

The pricing might slightly vary due to flash sales, and dollar market trends.
