**Total time spent so far: 42hrs**

## 11th June: Research
> Watched a lot of youtube tuts and read so many documents to get a basic idea and all of what i wanted make and make my keyboard look like.
> Decided to go with 75% Mechanical Keyboard layout (with 10 less keys) and some customisations.

> It is gonna have a a `EC11 Rotary Encoder`, and a `0.91" OLED SSD1306` and is gonna use `Rasberry pi Pico` for it's micro controller.

**Time Spent: 4hrs**

## 12th June: Started with sch
>I had done direct wiring before but never done the matrix wiring so first I learned how to do matrix wiring and how to use global Labels.

>did some basic wiring, after an hour of research wired everything to mcu.

**Time Spent: 5hrs**

## 13th June: Started with sch
>Completed the SCH and then moved on to PCB, Seriously It was pain, first I had to figureout how i can make the sizes of stwitches big and did all of them manually.
>Finnaly aligned all the switches and everything like the OLED and Encoder, the only things left are diodes

## 14th June: Started with PCB
>aligned everything as I wanted or we can say according to my layout, it was kinda messy thig but finally after 4 hours did it.
>Faced challenges withe pcb part, as i was using matrix, and its my first time working with it so yea it was kinda hard and faced issues like the component placement grid, finding where to put the diodes

>at last Done my component placement 

**Time Spent: 6hrs**

## 15th June:Done by PCB 
>Finally after 5hr I'm completely done with the PCB connected everything and named my board and also added orpheus at the bottom.

## 16th June:Started With CAD(3D)
>First I tohught it is gonna be easy I thought I can like use the guide of hackpad to make it, it is alot different, So made the bottom part but gonna make it again cause I don't think it is upto the mark.

## 18th June: Working on Case
>Working on CAD Gotta sleep now been working on it for like 6 hous the above case wasn't good enough so i'm working on new one the images are below.
>Really had issues with OnShape but still made it out.

**Time Spent: 6hrs**

## 21st June: Completed by the case or the 3D part
>faced alot of issues, like with onshpae but finally I made through and I love the fact that I hate onshape but still I'm loving onshape
>Made so much progress today, now I'm going to work on the firmware.
>>and all of sudden I just love highwaying, A very very big thanks to highway team.

## 22nd June: Completed by the firmware
I did some gpting since its very hard to make the firmware without having the parts with me ðŸ˜­. and BOOM I had a firmware, I made a tiny functions like for Encoder and OLED display.

**Time Spent: 2hrs**

## 26nd June: Made the changes that were requested
Made the changes in the Cad part and now my case looks so much good
