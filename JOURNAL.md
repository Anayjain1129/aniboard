## 11th June: Research
> Watched a lot of youtube tuts and read so many documents to get a basic idea and all of what i wanted make and make my keyboard look like.

> It is gonna have a a `EC11 Rotary Encoder`, and a `0.91" OLED SSD1306` and is gonna use `Rasberry pi Pico` for it's micro controller.

**Time Spent: 4hrs**

## 12th June: Started with sch
>I had done direct wiring before but never done the matrix wiring so first I learned how to do matrix wiring and how to use global Labels.

>did some basic wiring, after an hour of research wired everything to mcu.

**Time Spent: 5hrs**

## 13th June: Started with sch
>Completed the SCH and then moved on to PCB, Seriously It was pain, first I had to figureout how i can make the sizes of stwitches big and did all of them manually.
>Finnaly aligned all the switches and everything like the OLED and Encoder, the only things left are diodes

## 14th June: Started with PCB
>aligned everything as I wanted or we can say according to my layout, it was kinda messy thig but finally after 4 hours did it.
>Faced challenges withe pcb part, as i was using matrix, and its my first time working with it so yea it was kinda hard and faced issues like the component placement grid, finding where to put the diodes

>First I tohught it is gonna be easy I thought I can like use the guide of hackpad to make it, it is alot different, So made the bottom part but gonna make it again cause I don't think it is upto the mark.
